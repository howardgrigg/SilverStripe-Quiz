==============================

This is a simple module that adds a QuizPage to your site. The quiz can consist of multi-choice, true/false or short answer questions. Each question can have an image associated with it.

## Installation
 
Requires SilverStripe 3+
 
- Simply drop the 'quiz' folder into your webroot and visit http://yoursite.com/dev/build
- You can then add a QuizPage in the CMS

This was built to go inside the "Simple" theme that ships with SilverStripe but the CSS can easily be overridden to theme it to any site you're building.

Pull requests welcome :)
